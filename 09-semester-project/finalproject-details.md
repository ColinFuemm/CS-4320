Well, if "straightforward" is a criteria for "top five", then my top five are:

 - Community Activity
 - Distribution of Work
 - Contribution Diversity
 - Pull Request latency (I don't see it in our list - appears to be related to Issue Response Rate (only for PR) and Contribution Age (only, not 'last' but average age of all open))
 - License Coverage (that's the one I wanted on my previous list as #4)

From looking at the metrics table that has no entry in the column "Related Code/Queries", I the following are my top five:

 - Community Activity was mentioned often in interviews and appears to be one of the baseline metrics that we need to provide - even when it is meaningless by itself.
Truck/Bus Factor is another metric that everyone seems to know and makes intuitive sense to people.

 - Time to Contributor (related to Sean's Onion Layer) is a metric that is highly relevant to fostering a sustainable project and often talked about by practitions. I can foresee challenges with calculating it, especially after Jonathan Corbet's talk and realizing that we might not have a good project to verify this metric with.

 - License Declared because we have a history with SPDX, Kate is interested in this, and it appears to be easiest of the risk metrics and we do not have any risk metrics up to now.

 - Unity, Use of Acronyms, & Language Bias can all be generated through sentiment analysis. I think it would give us leverage if we could demonstrate our ability to do this challenging group of metrics.

 - @Sean: The onion layer distance might be a great metric to bring to the OSS-health-metrics mailing list and start a discussion there.
The following paper appears to be interesting in regards to differentiating the layers (in Zotero): Hann, I.-H., Roberts, J. A., & Slaughter, S. A. (2013).
