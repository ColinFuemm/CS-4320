# Cloning Instructions

**These instructions need to be performed from a command line**

**if you need a unix machine to do this on, you should have access to cs3380.rnet.missouri.edu with your pawprint.**

**Once you have cloned the repo as below in Hackers-To-Engineers, and given your team access, you should be able to use the GitHub desktop version the rest of the project**

1. Make a new  fork of Augur. 
2. Clone it on a computer. Could be your laptop, or a server. Be sure to follow the clone command with the name of your repo in Hackers-To-Engineers
   - git clone ....
3. You now have a local repo pointing to the ghdata project. You should remove the origin and point it to yours as remote.
  - cd ghdata-sprint1team-<<-TeamNumber->>
  - git remote remove origin
  - git remote add origin
  - git push --set-upstream origin master

You should now be ready to go!
